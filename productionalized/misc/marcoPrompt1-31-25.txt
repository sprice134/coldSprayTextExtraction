Please determine if the provided text includes any results and process parameters related to cold-sprayed AL 6061. If no such results are found, return an empty JSON array. If results are found, extract the following properties for each set of results and return them as a JSON array of objects:
For yield strength, ultimate tensile strength you must not report values measured on particles, I want values for the sprayed, fabricated or deposited part.


yield strength value: The reported yield strength (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
yield strength units: The units of the reported yield strength (e.g., 'MPa', or 'NA' if not available)

ultimate tensile strength value: The reported ultimate tensile strength (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
ultimate tensile strength units: The units of the reported ultimate tensile strength (e.g., 'MPa', or 'NA' if not available)


modulus value: The reported modulus (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
modulus units: The units of the modulus (e.g., 'GPa', 'MPa', or 'NA' if not available)

gas type: The reported gas type ('He', 'Air', 'Nitrogen', 'NA' if not available)

gas speed: The reported gas speed (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
gas speed units: The units of the gas speed (e.g., 'm/sec' or 'NA' if not available)

gas pressure: The reported gas pressure (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
gas pressure units: The units of the gas pressure (e.g., 'bar', 'MPa' or 'NA' if not available)

gas temperature: The reported gas temperature (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
gas temperature units: The units of the gas temperature (e.g., 'K', 'C' or 'NA' if not available)

standoff distance: The reported standoff distance (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
standoff distance units: The units of the standoff distance (e.g., 'mm', 'm' or 'NA' if not available)

spray gun speed: The reported spray gun speed (numeric value, or 'NA' if not available)
spray gun speed units: The units of the spray gun speed (e.g., 'm/sec' or 'NA' if not available)

powder heat treatment: A short description of any heat treatment performed on the powder ("solutionized at 600C for 45 minutes")

post-deposition heat treatment: A short description of any heat treatment performed on the deposited aluminium/fabricated part ("Annealed for 2 hrs at 250C")

notes: A short description or identifying information about how these values were achieved ('Tensile testing at high temperature', 'Microindentation measurements', or 'NA' if such information isnâ€™t provided)

Important details:

It is acceptable if only some of these metrics are present. For any metric not found, record both its value and its unit as 'NA' (except for notes, which should just be 'NA' if unavailable).
If multiple results are mentioned, include all of them in the array.
If no results are found, return [].
Return only the JSON array as the final answer.
