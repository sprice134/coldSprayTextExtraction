      "study also characterized the tensile properties in the through-thickness direction [32] and found them to differ from the values\n",
      "measured in the in-plane directions, due to the differing modes of fracture between particles when loaded in the through-thickness\n",

      "have focused on the anisotropy of critical fracture toughness.\n",
      "The goal of the present study is two-fold: (i) to investigate the fundamental nature of critical fracture in cold spray deposits for\n",
      "different crack orientations, and (ii) to quantify the level of anisotropy in critical fracture toughness. To this end, the fracture strength\n",
      "of as-sprayed bulk Al 6061 cold spray deposits is characterized using the ASTM E399 compact tension test. Six different crack ori-\n",
      "entations, relative to the spray directions, are tested, and the results are compared between them. The results are also compared to\n",
      "those from tests conducted on wrought Al 6061-T6 alloy. Finally, the anisotropy in fracture toughness is related to microstructural and\n",

      "2. Materials and methods\n",
      "2.1. Feedstock powder and substrate\n",
      "In this study, Al 6061 was chosen as the feedstock powder because of its common use in cold spray applications, its ready avail-\n",
      "ability, and the fact that its tensile mechanical properties have been studied extensively in the cold spray literature. The latter allows a\n",
      "basis for comparison for the present findings. Military specification (Mil-DTL-32495C, Amendment 2 [168]) powder was acquired\n",
      "from Valimet® (Stockton, CA, USA). Pre-spray particle size distribution was characterized using light microscopy and image analysis\n",
      "(c.f. Table 1). Per the manufacturer’s recommendation for removing adsorbed moisture from the powder prior to spraying, it was heat\n",
      "treated in air at 230 ◦C for one hour, then allowed to cool to room temperature. It was subsequently stored in a dry nitrogen glovebox\n",
      "until spraying.\n",
      "Substrate material consisted of 6.35-mm (1/4-in.) thick Al 6061-T651 plate stock. Surface preparation was performed by hand\n",
      "abrading with 3 M® Scotch-Brite pad, followed by cleaning with 100% ethanol. Spraying was subsequently conducted using the spray\n",

      "2.2. Direction conventions\n",
      "The notation prescribed in ASTM E8 [41] for defining the directions in wrought plate stock is adapted to the cold spray deposits in\n",
      "the present study. The long rastering direction is defined as the longitudinal, L, direction, the stepping direction as the transverse, T,\n",
      "direction, and the through-thickness direction as the short transverse, S, direction (Fig. 1). For defining crack orientation in the fracture\n",
      "samples, the paired-script convention in ASTM E399 is adopted, the first script corresponding to the direction of applied load, and the\n",
      "second script corresponding to direction of crack propagation (Fig. 1). For example, the T-S orientation corresponds to that in which\n",
      "the load is applied in the T direction and the crack propagates in the S direction. Using this convention, six fundamental crack ori-\n",
      "entations can be specified, as shown in Fig. 1.\n",
      "2.3. Porosity measurements\n",
      "Porosity measurements were made using the area percentage method specified in ASTM E2109-01 [42] using a sample from each of\n",
      "the three principle planes in the deposit—the S-T/T-S plane, the S-L/L-S plane, and L-T/T-L plane. Metallographic preparation was\n",
      "performed according to ASTM E3 [43], and light microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioscope® 7 MAT (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen,\n",
      "Germany). Three images were taken on each deposit plane, and porosity was measured using contrast-based image analysis.\n",
      "2.4. Fracture tests\n",
      "In the present study, two slightly different sizes of the ASTM E399 [27] compact tension specimen were used (Fig. 2). The specimen\n",
      "size depicted in Fig. 2a was based upon a characteristic length, W of 25 mm (as specified in the standard), and it was used to fabricate\n",
      "the L-T and T-L fracture specimens. The specimen size in Fig. 2b is a 4:5-scale version of the 25-mm specimen, with a characteristic\n",
      "length of 20 mm. It was used to fabricate the S-T, T-S, S-L, and L-S specimens. This scaling was done to accommodate a maximum\n",
      "deposit height limit as a result of a limited supply of helium, per spray. Such scaling is allowed by ASTM E399 and has no nominal effect\n",
      "on fracture toughness, so long as the test methodology and validity criteria in the standard are properly followed and met.\n",
      "Deposits were sprayed to accommodate between two and four fracture specimens from each crack orientation. Velocimetry\n",
      "measurements at the end of each were consistent, indicating that no major changes in spray parameters occurred during spraying. An\n",
      "overall range of 1110 ±160 m/s was measured, as indicated in Table 1. Following spraying, specimens were cut from each deposit\n",
      "using diamond saw sectioning, waterjet cutting, and surface end milling. All cutting processes used low cutting forces and liquid\n",
      "cooling to prevent mechanical and thermal damage to the deposit material.\n",
      "Prior to testing, fatigue pre-cracking was performed on an Instron® 1350 fatigue testing frame with a 100-kN load cell. Sinusoidal\n",
      "loading with a load ratio of R=Pmin/Pmax=0.1 and a frequency of 50 Hz was used. Load shedding was employed to maintain an\n",

      "their L-S helium-sprayed Al 1100 fracture specimens, and they characterized their fracture as transparticular.\n",
      "Finally, the fracture surface of the L-T specimen in Fig. 8 contains a mixture of both cleavage-like fracture and dimpling features\n",
      "that is intermediate to that of the S-T (Fig. 6) and T-S (Fig. 7) specimens. At first glance, this might suggest a mixture of interparticular\n",
      "and transparticular fracture that it intermediate between the two. However, the tortuosity of the fracture path on the fracture surface\n",
      "cross-section in Fig. 8 is on the order of the particle size. In addition, the dimples are small in scale, similar to those in Fig. 6; large-scale\n",
      "dimples characteristic of transparticular fracture (Fig. 7) are not present. Furthermore, many of the dimples are along the outer edges\n",
      "of the crescent-shaped smooth-walled cavities, suggesting shear failure along well-bonded regions of particle interfaces during particle\n",
      "pullout. These observations suggest that failure for the L-T/T-L specimens was largely interparticular like S-T/S-L specimens, but with\n",
      "perhaps a greater shear component than a normal one. Gavras, et al. [5] observed a similar fracture morphology in their fatigue\n",

      "as interparticular.\n",
      "The difference in the amounts of transparticular and interparticular fracture between the different crack/load orientations may\n",

      "S orientations than in the S-T/S-L and L-T/T-L orientations may be due to the fact that the orientation of particle interfaces in the\n",
      "former (Fig. 9b and c) is almost entirely perpendicular to the global crack path (Fig. 9a). When fracture is transparticular (Fig. 9b), it\n",
      "possesses a high toughness, due to the high fracture energy associated with cohesive rupture of the particles. (The energy of bulk\n",
      "fracture through a particle – which can be estimated from the bulk fracture energy of wrought Al 6061 [66] – is on the order of 104 J/\n",
      "m2 – much higher than the energy of interfacial fracture between particles. The latter is on the order of 1 to 10 J/m2 and has been\n",
      "estimated from single particle impact experiments [67] and finite element simulations [68–70].) When fracture is interparticular, on\n",
      "the other hand (Fig. 9c), the fracture energy is lower, but the crack path is longer and fracture occurs predominantly in shear mode\n",
      "(mode II). The latter two factors increase the overall fracture toughness, possibly enough to make the interparticular fracture toughness\n",
      "equivalent to the transparticular toughness.\n",
      "In contrast to the T-S/L-S orientations, interparticular fracture in the S-T/S-L and L-T/T-L orientations (Fig. 9d and e, respectively)\n",
      "exhibits a shorter crack path and a lower mode II component. For the S-T/S-L orientations (Fig. 9d), the fracture path is very straight,\n",
      "and the fracture mode is almost purely opening (mode I) – which has a lower toughness than mode II. For the L-T/T-L orientations, the\n",
      "crack is still moderately straight, and some mode I fracture is present in addition to mode II. These factors may result in an overall\n",
      "fracture toughness that is lower for interparticular fracture than transparticular.\n",
      "The above line of reasoning may also explain why the global fracture toughness was higher in the T-S/L-S orientations than in the S-\n",
      "T/S-L and L-T/T-L orientations. The longer crack path and primarily mode II fracture of the former would have resulted in a higher\n",
      "overall fracture toughness. Furthermore, the equivalence in fracture toughness between the latter two orientations may be explained\n",
      "by the fact that the cohesive fracture energy of the particle is several orders of magnitude greater than interfacial fracture energy, while\n",
      "the fracture energies associated with mode I vs. mode II fracture are likely of the same order of magnitude (or only as much as one order\n",
      "of magnitude different). Since fracture in the S-T/S-L and L-T/T-L orientations contained little to no transparticular component, their\n",

      "In the present work, tensile and fracture anisotropy were studied in helium-sprayed bulk Al 6061 cold spray deposits. The findings\n",
      "can be summarized as follows:\n",

      "4.1. Tensile properties\n",
      "Tensile properties (elastic modulus, yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation at break) were measured in the two in-plane\n",
      "deposit (the long-rastering, L, and stepping, T) directions; the out-of-plane (S direction) was not tested.\n",
      "• No anisotropy was observed for the properties, likely due to uniform in-plane microstructure as a result of small step size and high\n",
      "nozzle traverse speed.\n",
      "• The tensile properties were lower than those for wrought, with values consistent with those from other studies.\n",
      "4.2. Fracture toughness\n",
      "Fracture toughness was characterized using the ASTM E399 compact tension specimen. Testing was performed in six principal\n",
      "load/crack direction pairs defined with respect to the spray directions.\n",
      "• Fracture toughness was observed to be transversely isotropic. No anisotropy was observed when the crack path orientation was\n",
      "within the spray plane (in-plane, mean KIc of 11.0 ±0.6 MPa√m). Slightly higher fracture toughnesses were observed when the\n",
      "crack path orientation was perpendicular to the spray plane (out-of-plane, mean KIc of 13.0 ±0.5 MPa√m).\n",
      "• The fracture toughness range was 40–50% that of wrought and consistent with other values in the literature.\n",
      "• The in-plane fracture toughness values were consistent with the in-plane tensile properties, according to the classic Hahn and\n",
      "Rosenfield relation [61].\n",
      "• In-plane fracture was characterized by almost 100% fracture between particles (interparticular), while out-of-plane contained a\n",
      "mixture of interparticular and transparticular fracture (fracture through particles).\n",
      "• A greater amount of transparticular fracture was observed in orientations with higher fracture toughness.\n",
      "• When fracture was primarily interparticular, local fracture mode (mode I or mode II) showed no significant influence on fracture\n",
      "toughness.\n",
      "• Overall, anisotropy (15–20%) was low, likely due to good particle bonding as a result of the use of effective spray parameters and\n",
      "helium as the accelerating gas\n",
      "Future studies would benefit from exploring the relationship between process parameters and fracture toughness. For example, the\n",
