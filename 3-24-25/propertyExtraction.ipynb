Representative tensile coupons were stressed to 25%, 65% and 85% of their respective yield strength and exposed to ASTM B117 salt fog for 90 days. After exposure, the samples were mechanically tested to failure, and subsequently investigated for stress corrosion cracking via optical and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results were compared to the wrought Al 6061-T6 properties and correlated with the observed microstructures. Wrought samples showed the initiation of stress corrosion cracking, while the cold-sprayed deposits appeared to be unaffected or affected by general corrosion only. Optical microscopy revealed evidence of stress corrosion cracking in the form of intergranular corrosion in the wrought samples, while no significant corrosion was observed in the cold-sprayed deposits. Fractography revealed wrought samples failed due to multiple mechanisms, with predominant cleavage and intergranular failure, but cold-sprayed samples only failed by ductile dimple rupture. The difference in SCC response between the differently processed materials is attributed to the documented benefits of the cold spray process, which includes maintaining fine grain structure of the feedstock powder and high density after consolidation, low oxidation, and work hardening effect.</jats:p>\",\n",

    "            \"Abstract\": \"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cold spray (CS) is a solid-state process for depositing thick layers of material via the successive high-velocity impact of powder particles onto a solid surface, which leads to high rates of deformation, interparticle bonding, and coating build-up. Although CS is finding commercial utilization in non-load-bearing repair and coating applications, clear nondestructive characterization procedures are necessary to realize its potential in load-bearing structural applications. In this study, the viability of electrical conductivity and through thickness ultrasound wave velocity measurement methods was studied to serve as a means for nondestructive quantitative measurement for quality control in CS and potentially other additive manufacturing (AM) methods. Eddy current, ultrasound, porosity, hardness, and uniaxial tensile strength tests were conducted on CS deposited layers of aluminum alloy 6061 and copper on aluminum alloy 6061 and commercially pure copper substrates, respectively. CS gas dynamic parameters were intentionally and systematically varied to result in corresponding discrete differences in mechanical properties of deposits. Ultrasound measurements of longitudinal wave velocity and eddy current electrical conductivity measurements showed good correlation with process conditions, microstructural characterization results, and destructive mechanical tests (hardness, tensile). The results of this work show that ultrasound wave velocity and electrical conductivity correlate well with increased particle impact velocity in CS deposited aluminum and copper blocks, which evidently show an incremental decrease in porosity, increase in hardness, and increase in tensile strength. The outlined ultrasound and eddy current nondestructive testing methods present effective means for quantitative assessment of cold spray deposited structures while intact with the substrate.</jats:p>\",\n",
