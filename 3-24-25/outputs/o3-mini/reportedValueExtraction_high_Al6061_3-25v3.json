            "Abstract": "<jats:p>The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) response of Al 6061 bulk deposits produced by high-pressure cold spray (HPCS) was investigated and compared to commercial wrought Al 6061-T6 material. Representative tensile coupons were stressed to 25%, 65% and 85% of their respective yield strength and exposed to ASTM B117 salt fog for 90 days. After exposure, the samples were mechanically tested to failure, and subsequently investigated for stress corrosion cracking via optical and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results were compared to the wrought Al 6061-T6 properties and correlated with the observed microstructures. Wrought samples showed the initiation of stress corrosion cracking, while the cold-sprayed deposits appeared to be unaffected or affected by general corrosion only. Optical microscopy revealed evidence of stress corrosion cracking in the form of intergranular corrosion in the wrought samples, while no significant corrosion was observed in the cold-sprayed deposits. Fractography revealed wrought samples failed due to multiple mechanisms, with predominant cleavage and intergranular failure, but cold-sprayed samples only failed by ductile dimple rupture. The difference in SCC response between the differently processed materials is attributed to the documented benefits of the cold spray process, which includes maintaining fine grain structure of the feedstock powder and high density after consolidation, low oxidation, and work hardening effect.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cold spray (CS) is a solid-state process for depositing thick layers of material via the successive high-velocity impact of powder particles onto a solid surface, which leads to high rates of deformation, interparticle bonding, and coating build-up. Although CS is finding commercial utilization in non-load-bearing repair and coating applications, clear nondestructive characterization procedures are necessary to realize its potential in load-bearing structural applications. In this study, the viability of electrical conductivity and through thickness ultrasound wave velocity measurement methods was studied to serve as a means for nondestructive quantitative measurement for quality control in CS and potentially other additive manufacturing (AM) methods. Eddy current, ultrasound, porosity, hardness, and uniaxial tensile strength tests were conducted on CS deposited layers of aluminum alloy 6061 and copper on aluminum alloy 6061 and commercially pure copper substrates, respectively. CS gas dynamic parameters were intentionally and systematically varied to result in corresponding discrete differences in mechanical properties of deposits. Ultrasound measurements of longitudinal wave velocity and eddy current electrical conductivity measurements showed good correlation with process conditions, microstructural characterization results, and destructive mechanical tests (hardness, tensile). The results of this work show that ultrasound wave velocity and electrical conductivity correlate well with increased particle impact velocity in CS deposited aluminum and copper blocks, which evidently show an incremental decrease in porosity, increase in hardness, and increase in tensile strength. The outlined ultrasound and eddy current nondestructive testing methods present effective means for quantitative assessment of cold spray deposited structures while intact with the substrate.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Cold-spray-processed aluminum alloys have static mechanical properties superior to those of aerospace cast alloys, and similar to those of their wrought counterparts, making them good candidates for structural applications. However, their broad and confident use relies upon systematic fatigue crack growth studies to investigate and demonstrate the materials\u2019 performance in critical high-integrity components. In this work, the fatigue crack growth behavior in early stages (small crack growth regime) was investigated for cold-spray processed 6061 aluminum alloys and coatings, at stress ratio <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>\u2009=\u20090.1, in room temperature laboratory air. The effects of the characteristic microstructure and initial flaw size on the fatigue crack growth response were systematically examined, and the crack growth mechanisms at the microstructural scale were established and compared to those of long cracks. The mechanical interfacial stability of coatings was examined in cold-spray 6061\u2013rolled 6061-T6 couples. An original method of quantifying the deposition\u2013substrate interfacial strength, and correlating it to the response under cyclic loading <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> crack-interface stability maps, was developed. The proposed methodology is based on combined scratch testing and fracture mechanics formulations, and failure at the coating\u2013substrate interface can be predicted for any crack growth scenario under cyclic loading. The method can be broadly used for the design and optimization of cold-spray and other coatings, as well as in structural repair.</jats:p>",

The splat formations were realistically presented; the temperature evolution throughout the deposition process stayed below the melting point of Al-6061, and the feedstock particles exhibited restitution for impact velocities lower than 200\u00a0m/s. Feedstock particles with elongated morphology experienced a lower elastic strain energy level than spherical morphology after impact, which implied the relative bond strength was higher for elongated particles than spherical particles. The displacement curves in single particle simulations for both morphologies suggested a spherical particle experienced a greater shock than the elongated particle upon impact. The relative bond strength achieved by multiple particle impact was lower than the single particle impact, even though the displacement curves showed the feedstock particles were individually embedded in the substrate.</jats:p>",

The cold sprayed deposition was also analysed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Segregation of the solute atoms (Mg and Si) at the grain boundaries during cold spraying was seen to play a crucial role in stabilising the deformation substructure until specific temperatures, and was found to have a significant effect on the annealing behaviour of the microstructure in the two different directions. </jats:p>",

It aims to determine the acceptable data needed to meet regulatory requirement when substantiating cold spray repairs. The study focuses on repairs of non-principal structural element (PSE) structures such as skin and panels that are prone to corrosion and wear. For cold spray repair of such components, the microstructure, tensile, peel, bearing, and bending strength from the repair process and powder materials of Al-2024 and Al-7075, were identified and investigated in accordance with MIL-STD-3021. Results show an average coating porosity of &lt;1.2% for both materials. Average tensile strength was 247.1 MPa (with elongation of 0.76%) for Al-2024 and 264.0 MPa (with elongation of 0.87%) for Al-7075. Al-2024 has an average peel strength of 71.9 MPa, while Al-7075 is at 48.9 MPa. The Al-2024 bearing test specimens gave a maximum load strength before failure of 633.6 MPa, while the Al-7075 gave 762.7 MPa. The bending tests show good flexibility for coating thickness ranges of typical skin and panel parts. The results show that cold spray can be used to restore thickness and oversized hole diameters for Al-2024 and Al-7075 skin and panels. The bearing test conducted in this study has also demonstrated a new test method to determine the bearing load and yield strength of a cold spray-repaired hole in a plate.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:p>Process optimization and quality control are important issues in cold spraying and coating development. Because the cold spray processing is based on high kinetic energy by high particle velocities, online spray monitoring of particle inflight properties can be used as an assisting process tool. Particle velocities, their positions in the spray jet, and particle size measurements give valuable information about spraying conditions. This, in turn, improves reproducibility and reliability of coating production. This study focuses on cold spraying of Al6061 material and the connections between particle inflight properties and coating characteristics such as structures and mechanical properties. Furthermore, novel 2D velocity scan maps done with the HW CS2 online spray monitoring system are presented as an advantageous powder and spray condition controlling tool. Cold spray processing conditions were similar using different process parameters, confirmed with the online spray monitoring prior to coating production. Higher particle velocities led to higher particle deformation and thus, higher coating quality, denser structures, and improved adhesions. Also, deposition efficiency increased significantly by using higher particle velocities.</jats:p>",

The microstructure of the copper-coated graphite and copper composite coatings was visually examined using photographs taken with an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The surface roughness of the coatings was investigated with a 3D profilometer. The thickness of the coatings was determined through the analysis of the microstructure images, while the adhesion of the coatings was characterized using the scratch test method. The results indicate that the surface roughness of the coatings sprayed on the two different substrates gradually decreases as gas temperature and gas pressure increase. Additionally, the thickness and adhesion of the coatings deposited on the two different substrates both increase with an increase in gas temperature and gas pressure. Comparing the surface roughness, thickness, and adhesion of the coatings deposited on the two different substrates, the surface roughness and adhesion of the coatings on the soft substrate are greater than those of the coatings on the hard substrate, while the thickness of the coatings is not obviously affected by the hardness of the substrate. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the surface roughness, thickness, and adhesion of the copper-coated graphite and copper composite coatings sprayed on the two different substrates exhibit a distinct linear relationship with particle velocity.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cold spray (CS) is a solid-state additive manufacturing process that can create high-density, high-performance deposits for many applications. Aluminum alloys have been the target of recent CS research due to their excellent mechanical behavior when cold-sprayed. The introduction of new Al alloys to CS is of interest as unique properties may be achieved, especially when powder is heat-treated prior to deposition. In this study, three batches of Al F357 powder\u2014a control as-atomized, heat-treated at 230\u00a0\u00b0C for 75\u00a0min and heat-treated at 385\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h\u2014were studied. Scanning electron microscopy revealed microstructural modifications after heat treatment in the powder and sprayed deposits. X-ray diffraction highlighted the presence of eutectic Si, Mg<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Si and SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in all specimens. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy showed the spheroidization of Si during the 385\u00a0\u00b0C heat treatment, with an increase in the fraction of Mg<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Si during both treatments. Nanohardness and microhardness testing showed a decrease in hardness with thermal processing in both the powder and sprayed deposits. Tensile testing demonstrated ductile behavior from both heat-treated powders, but significantly higher strengths from the 230\u00a0\u00b0C treatment. These results suggest Al F357 may be used in CS when appropriate powder heat treatments are applied.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, the influence of thermal pre-processing upon the microstructure and hardness of Al 6061 feedstock powder is considered through the lens of cold spray processing and additive manufacturing. Since solid-state cold spray processes refine and retain microstructural constituents following impact-driven and high-strain rate severe plastic deformation and bonding, thermal pre-processing enables application-driven tuning of the resultant consolidation achieved via microstructural and, therefore, mechanical manipulation of the feedstock prior to use. Microstructural analysis was achieved via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and differential thermal calorimetry. On the other hand, nanoindentation testing and analysis were relied upon to quantify pre-processing effects and microstructural evolution influences on the resultant hardness as a function of time at 540 \u00b0C. In the case of the as-atomized powder, \u03b2-Mg2Si-, Al-Fe-, and Mg-Si-type phases were observed along polycrystalline grain boundaries. Furthermore, after a 60 min hold time at 540 \u00b0C, Al-Fe-Si-Cr-Mn- and Mg-Si-type intermetallic phases were also observed along grain boundaries. Furthermore, the as-atomized hardness at 250 nm of indentation depth was 1.26 GPa and continuously decreased as a function of hold time until reaching 0.88 GPa after 240 min at 540 \u00b0C. Finally, contextualization of the observations with tuning cold spray additive manufacturing part performance via powder pre-processing is presented for through-process and application-minded design.</jats:p>",

As of late, cold spray has also emerged as a high deposition rate metal additive manufacturing method for structural and nonstructural applications. As cold spray enjoys wider recognition and adoption, the demand for versatile, high-throughput and significant methods of particulate feedstock as well consolidated materials characterization has also become more notable. In order to address the interest for such an instrument, nanoindentation is presented herein as a viable means of achieving the desired mechanical characterization abilities. In this work, conventionally static nanoindentation testing using both Berkovich and spherical indenter tips, as well as nanoindentation using the continuous stiffness measurement mode of testing, will be applied to a range of powder-based feedstocks and cold sprayed materials.</jats:p>",

A 1wt% stable suspension of 30nm Al2O3 particles was decorated onto primary AA6061using a redispersion method. The resulting AA6061-1wt% Al2O3 composite powder was mixed in a rotary mixer for one hour and subsequently dried at 45\u00b0C. Scanning electron microscopy of the composite powder confirmed the successful material composition. The composite powders were then deposited onto an AA6061 substrate using a low-pressure cold spray system, with the coating quality, deposition efficiency, surface roughness, and hardness of the deposited materials analyzed. After heat treatment at 430oC, the role of the nanoparticles in hindering recrystallization was studied, with Orowan strengthening shown to be the main mechanism for preventing recrystallization and grain growth. This technique provides a promising alternative method for producing metal matrix composites and offers potential for further exploration of their properties and applications.</jats:p>",

As a result, cold spray processing enables unique freedoms regarding feedstock, which can be pre-processed using chemical, thermal, and mechanical treatments to produce powder properties that achieve finely controlled consolidations with application-specific behaviors. Given such features of the cold spray process, the present review article is concerned with the through-process integration of mechanically and microstructurally characterized feedstocks for optimizable cold spray metal additive manufacturing. Therefore, in this paper, we consider how nanoindentation (dynamic, static, and quasi-static) was coupled with microstructural characterization for experimental feedstock evaluation, testing, and characterization. Atomized aluminum alloys, atomized stainless steel, and copper feedstocks, among others, were considered. Accordingly, the review validates how microparticle feedstock pre-processing and characterization in cold spray metal additive manufacturing and processing lead to controllable component performance and properties.</jats:p>",

In this work, five different N2 process gas temperatures between 700 and 1100 \u00b0C were employed to understand the formation of cold sprayed (CS) Zr coatings and their feasibility for enhanced wear resistance. Results indicated that the N2 processing gas temperature of about 1100 \u00b0C enabled a higher degree of particle thermal softening, which created a dense, robust, oxide- and defect-free Zr coating. Across all CS Zr coatings, there was a refinement of crystallinity, which was attributed to the severe localized plastic deformation of the powder particles. The enhanced thermal boost up zone at the inter-particle boundaries and decreased recoverable elastic strain were accountable for the inter-particle bonding of the coatings at higher process gas temperatures. The flattening ratio (\u03b5) increased as a function of temperature, implying that there was a greater degree of plastic deformation at higher N2 gas temperatures. The microhardness readings and wear volume of the coatings were also improved as a function of process gas temperature. In this work, the wear of the Al6061 alloy substrate was mainly plowing-based, whereas the Zr CS substrates demonstrated a gradual change of abrasive to adhesive wear. From our findings, the preparation of CS Zr coatings was a feasible method of enhancing the wear resistance of Al-based alloys.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, three commercially available aluminum alloy systems (Al 2024, Al 6061, and Al 7075) were considered to explicitly capture the differences in material properties associated with a rapidly solidified, gas-atomized particulate feedstock as compared with their conventionally cast counterparts. Differences between the microstructural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and kinetic behaviors associated with gas-atomized and conventionally bulk counterparts have been tacitly assumed by the cold spray community. However, many researchers continue to utilize legacy properties from bulk materials when simulating particle impact phenomena in silico, for example. By way of recognizing the fact that bulk material properties may not serve as substitutes for gas-atomized powder property input parameters for cold spray process simulation and computation in silico, enhanced cold spray research and development will be more easily achieved. Therefore, understanding the feedstock powder characteristics for use in cold spray can lead to fine-tuning the properties of cold spray consolidations. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nanoindentation, microhardness, differential scanning calorimetry, elemental analysis, and cooling rate calculations were utilized. This work confirms preliminary findings that powder alloys may not be treated the same way as their bulk counterparts in so far as the enactment of heat treatment processing parameters are concerned. Specifically, vast discrepancies were found in the grain size, secondary phases, and mechanical behavior between the powder and cast versions of each alloy.</jats:p>",

This will bring out huge losses and reduce the safety and stability of trains. In order to solve the problem, cold spray process was used for repairing the damage of the aluminum alloy components with Al-based powders. Microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion behavior were studied. The results indicated that there were very few pores and cracks in the repaired areas after repairing. The average microhardness of the repaired areas was 54.5 HV \u00b1 3.4 HV, and the tensile strength of the repaired samples was 160.4 MPa. After neutral salt spray tests for 1000 h, the rate of mass loss of the samples repaired by cold spray was lower than that of 6A01 aluminum alloy. The electrochemical test results showed that the repaired areas had a higher open circuit potential than 6A01 aluminum alloy. As a result, the repaired areas such as the anode protected its nearby substrate. The samples repaired by cold spray exhibited better corrosion than 6A01 aluminum alloy. Cold spray process and Al-based powders are applicable for repairing the aluminum alloy components of high-speed trains.</jats:p>",

To this end, it is first shown that provided the bulk stress in a 7075 cold spray coating can be kept beneath approximately 150 MPa, then the coating should not crack. A range of examples are presented in which the interface between the coating and the substrate only fails subsequent to crack growth in the substrate. We also show that failure of cold spray repaired/coated panels can also be due to the nucleation and growth of cracks in the substructure immediately adjacent to the coated/repaired region. As such, when performing a durability analysis for a cold spray repair, the growth of such small naturally occurring cracks, both at the interface and immediately adjacent to the ends of the coating, need to be accounted for.</jats:p>",

In this work, a viable strategy of \u201ccold spraying + hot rolling post-treatment\u201d was successfully applied to prepare wear-resistant B<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>C/6061 Al composite coating on commercially available 6061 Al plates. The results revealed that hot rolling post-treatment results in uniform distribution of B<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>C particles in the alloy matrix, good inter-splat bonding, and sufficient plasticity in the splats through effective healing of the defects and splat boundaries in the as-sprayed deposit. As a result, the coating/substrate bonding strength in the hot rolled sample increased two-fold when compared with that of the as-sprayed sample. Moreover, hot rolling process resulted in much improved tribological properties of the coating with the wear rate \u223c40% of that of the substrate. The obtained results indicated that the idea of combining cold spraying and hot rolling treatment is quite effective for improving the tribological properties of Al alloy plates. Further, this approach seems equally good for repairing/remanufacturing of unserviceable 6061 Al alloy components.</jats:p>",

The Al-Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> MMC coating was developed on AZ31B magnesium alloy using a LPCS system. FSP was performed on the MMC coating using a stirring tool made of H13 tool steel. The structural integrity of the coating was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The phase analysis of coating was studied using x-ray diffraction (XRD). The potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed to study the corrosion resistance of cold sprayed and FSPed samples. Results showed that FSP improved the structural integrity of MMC coating. Both the EIS and potentiodynamic polarisation test results reveal that FSP treated samples provide superior corrosion resistance than cold sprayed samples. This is due to the increase in interfacial bonding between matrix and reinforcement phase. The degree of separation and dispersal of alumina in the Al alloy matrix is increased through the shear force generated by the FSP tool on the coating surface.</jats:p>",

Upon microstructure and mechanical characterization, CSAM Aluminum 6061 showed non-uniformity with spatial variation in the microstructure and mechanical properties, affecting the overall response of the additively manufactured parts. Post-processing treatments are conducted in as-printed samples to improve particle bonding, relieve residual stresses, and improve mechanical properties. In this work, we attempt to implement the effects of grain size and distribution of smaller grains along the intersplat boundaries using the grain size distribution function and powder size information to accurately predict the deformation response of cold-sprayed material using a mean-field viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) model. The incorporation of an intersplat boundary term in the VPSC model resulted in a stress\u2013strain response closely matching the experimental findings, preventing the superficially high stresses observed due to Hall\u2013Petch effects from ultra-fine-grain structures. Likewise, the results from the grain analysis showed the combined effects of grain size, orientation, and intersplat mechanisms that captured the stresses experienced and strain accommodated by individual grains.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Cold spray (CS) is a solid-state process for depositing thick layers of material via the successive high-velocity impact of powder particles onto a solid surface, which leads to high rates of deformation, interparticle bonding, and coating build-up. Although CS is finding commercial utilization in non-load-bearing repair and coating applications, clear nondestructive characterization procedures are necessary to realize its potential in load-bearing structural applications. In this study, the viability of electrical conductivity and through thickness ultrasound wave velocity measurement methods was studied to serve as a means for nondestructive quantitative measurement for quality control in CS and potentially other additive manufacturing (AM) methods. Eddy current, ultrasound, porosity, hardness, and uniaxial tensile strength tests were conducted on CS deposited layers of aluminum alloy 6061 and copper on aluminum alloy 6061 and commercially pure copper substrates, respectively. CS gas dynamic parameters were intentionally and systematically varied to result in corresponding discrete differences in mechanical properties of deposits. Ultrasound measurements of longitudinal wave velocity and eddy current electrical conductivity measurements showed good correlation with process conditions, microstructural characterization results, and destructive mechanical tests (hardness, tensile). The results of this work show that ultrasound wave velocity and electrical conductivity correlate well with increased particle impact velocity in CS deposited aluminum and copper blocks, which evidently show an incremental decrease in porosity, increase in hardness, and increase in tensile strength. The outlined ultrasound and eddy current nondestructive testing methods present effective means for quantitative assessment of cold spray deposited structures while intact with the substrate.</jats:p>",

            "Abstract": "<jats:p>The stress corrosion cracking (SCC) response of Al 6061 bulk deposits produced by high-pressure cold spray (HPCS) was investigated and compared to commercial wrought Al 6061-T6 material. Representative tensile coupons were stressed to 25%, 65% and 85% of their respective yield strength and exposed to ASTM B117 salt fog for 90 days. After exposure, the samples were mechanically tested to failure, and subsequently investigated for stress corrosion cracking via optical and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results were compared to the wrought Al 6061-T6 properties and correlated with the observed microstructures. Wrought samples showed the initiation of stress corrosion cracking, while the cold-sprayed deposits appeared to be unaffected or affected by general corrosion only. Optical microscopy revealed evidence of stress corrosion cracking in the form of intergranular corrosion in the wrought samples, while no significant corrosion was observed in the cold-sprayed deposits. Fractography revealed wrought samples failed due to multiple mechanisms, with predominant cleavage and intergranular failure, but cold-sprayed samples only failed by ductile dimple rupture. The difference in SCC response between the differently processed materials is attributed to the documented benefits of the cold spray process, which includes maintaining fine grain structure of the feedstock powder and high density after consolidation, low oxidation, and work hardening effect.</jats:p>",
