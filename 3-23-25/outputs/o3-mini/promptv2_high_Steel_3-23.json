It covers the fundamentals and processing principles of cold spray deposition, emphasizing its solid\u2010state, low thermal input nature that minimizes oxidation while enabling rapid, high\u2010density coating build\u2010up. Several chapters detail how process parameters such as gas temperature, pressure, stand\u2010off distance, powder feed rate, particle size, and substrate properties affect deposition efficiency, microstructure evolution, and mechanical properties.\n\nA significant portion of the text is devoted to advanced modeling and simulation tools for predicting coating build\u2010up. Multiple approaches are discussed, including finite element analysis, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and morphological modeling that incorporates particle impedance, impact angle, and toolpath planning. These predictive models are intended to optimize deposition parameters to achieve desired shapes and near\u2010net\u2010shape components while minimizing post\u2010processing.\n\nOther sections investigate the use of laser assistance\u2014both co\u2010axial and off\u2010axis configurations\u2014to improve deposition efficiency and enable the use of less expensive gases. Laser heating softens the substrate and powder particles, reducing the critical velocity for bonding and fostering improved interparticle cohesion, even for harder materials such as titanium alloys or shape memory alloys like CuAlNi. Moreover, comprehensive non\u2010destructive inspection methods such as Optical Coherence Tomography and laser ultrasonic testing are presented for in\u2010process dimensional analysis, flaw detection, and bond integrity assessment.\n\nCollectively, the volume provides a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art review of cold spray additive manufacturing, presenting experimental results, simulation studies, and advanced inspection techniques that together offer guidelines for improved process control, material performance, and integration into industrial applications."

        "link": "https://digital.wpi.edu/downloads/9s161933d",
        "extractedText": "The dissertation text provides a very detailed account of both modeling/simulation and experimental work in two different areas: (1) all\u2010solid\u2010state lithium battery (ASSB) interfacial contact and deformation under different stack pressures, and (2) cold spray deposition of refractory tantalum (Ta) powders on Ta and 4340 steel substrates.\n\nBelow is a summary of the key simulation and experimental results described in the text:\n\n1. All\u2010Solid\u2010State Battery (ASSB) Results  \n\u2003\u2022 A combined analytical, computational (FEM), and experimental study was carried out on a model ASSB based on a LiBH\u2084\u2013LiNH\u2082 solid electrolyte.  \n\u2003\u2022 The dissertation uses the Hertzian contact model (analytical) and axisymmetric finite element modeling to simulate interfacial contact between the electrolyte and the cathode. The simulations show that as the applied stack pressure increases, the contact radius improves (i.e. better interfacial contact), but the cost is an increase in localized axial and shear strains at the interface.  \n\u2003\u2022 Experimental measurements using digital image correlation (DIC) during compression tests captured local strain distributions. Initially (at 0 MPa) there is little deformation, but increasing pressure (up to 1 MPa) closes gaps and enhances contact. However, at higher pressures the imposed stresses cause significant plastic deformation and microcracking\u2014which may eventually lower the ionic conductivity.  \n\u2003\u2022 Electrochemical tests (impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry) reveal that there is an optimum stack pressure\u2014around 0.26 MPa\u2014in which the electrolyte\u2013electrode interfacial contact is maximized while induced strains remain in the elastic range. At this optimum, the measured room\u2010temperature ionic conductivity reaches about 9\u00d710\u207b\u2075 S/cm. Pressures above this value are found to lead to increased damage (large axial/shear strains), which degrade cell performance.\n\n2. Cold Spray (CS) of Refractory Ta Powders  \n\u2003\u2022 The work explores the role of deformation and cracking during cold spray deposition of Ta powders onto Ta and 4340 steel substrates.  \n\u2003\u2022 Experimental characterization (SEM, FIB, TEM) of the Ta powders shows that the particles are coated by a nanoscale (\u22482.8 nm) amorphous TaO\u2093 film.  \n\u2003\u2022 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to obtain the mechanical properties of top surface oxides (both for Ta and for the oxide on 4340 steel, modeled here as Fe\u2082O\u2083). These calculated properties (elastic moduli, Poisson\u2019s ratio, tensile strength, etc.) serve as inputs for the finite element simulations.  \n\u2003\u2022 Finite element analyses (conducted in ABAQUS\u2013Explicit) simulate the impact of a single Ta particle (with an average diameter of about 10\u2005\u00b5m) at an impact velocity of ~680 m/s. The simulations show that high-velocity impacts generate localized temperature rises (although still below the melting point of Ta) and very high plastic strains in the particle and substrate at the contact region.  \n\u2003\u2022 The modeling also tracks the evolution of stress fields and predicts the initiation and propagation of microcracks, particularly in the oxide layers on both the particle and the substrate. In addition, parametric studies indicate that higher impact velocities and thicker oxide layers lead to a lower fraction of oxides being fractured\u2014in other words, optimal conditions for oxide disruption (which is necessary for achieving metal-to-metal bonding) depend critically on both spray velocity and oxide thickness.\n\n3. Overall Implications and Conclusions  \n\u2003\u2022 In the ASSB study, it is shown that moderate stack pressure is beneficial because it improves interfacial contacts and ionic conductivity, whereas too high a pressure induces damaging strains that can trigger plasticity and microcracking.  \n\u2003\u2022 In cold spray processing, controlling the oxide character (its thickness and propensity to crack) and achieving sufficient particle impact energy are both essential for promoting metallurgical bonding between the particle and the substrate.  \n\u2003\u2022 The combined experimental, analytical, and computational approaches demonstrate that optimizing mechanical loading parameters (whether in battery assembly or in cold spray deposition) is key to enhancing performance and durability.  \n\u2003\u2022 Finally, the text outlines opportunities for future work including the use of machine learning to optimize parameter effects in ASSBs and further investigation (and possible extension of computational models) into the complex thermo-mechanical behavior in high-velocity cold spray processes.\n\nThis multi-scale investigation clearly shows how interfacial contact, induced interfacial stress/strain and material degradation phenomena play a critical role in both solid\u2013state battery performance and in the quality of cold-sprayed deposits.\n\n"
